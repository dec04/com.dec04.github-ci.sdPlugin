## Why?

I really like the Stream Desk platform, and I use it to the maximum. But unfortunately I did not find the plugins I
needed, so I decided to make them myself.

<p>These plugin are provided 'as is'.</p>

### P.S.

I hope you enjoy extending your Stream Deck with my plugin.

Enjoy!

Your <mark>Dec04</mark> chaps.
